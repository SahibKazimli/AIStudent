# Week 6
We discussed on how to run processing pipelines on Modal. Here you'll try to analyse the systems by tweaking some parameters and understanding the results.

## Task 1
Try to use Modal's metrics and analyse the CPU, RAM and GPU utilisation for the current process(You can find this in the Apps/container dashboard). Is that optimal? Try to find modal documentation on how to limit CPU and RAM for a given app. What if you don't use a GPU?

## Task 2
We had a very simple schedule to run the app. What if there is a complex schedule like every other day of the week(Mon, Wed, Fri)? Explore Cron and try to schedule tasks for complex schedules.

## Task 3
We have used a `batch_size` parameter and set it $8$. Why $8$? Try bigger batch sizes and see how the system usage changes. Compare execution times, RAM usage and GPU VRAM usage for atleast 5 different batch sizes?

## Task 4
Repeat the above Tasks 1 and 3 with the 100k dataset and find out why it fails. **Hint** - Data gets 10 times larger but the GPU memory stays the same. A10G has 10GB VRAM. Change it to an appropriate GPU with enough memory(https://modal.com/docs/guide/gpu) and try to run it. What if you don't use GPU/cuda?
